<h1>Correlation Matrix Plotter</h1>
This Python script allows you to easily visualize the correlation between different variables in a given dataset. It uses the popular Pandas library to read the dataset and the Matplotlib library to generate the correlation matrix plot.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To use this script, you need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

<ul>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>
You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the script, simply import it into your Python code and call the plot_correlation_matrix function, passing in the dataset as a Pandas DataFrame.
This will generate a plot of the correlation matrix, showing the correlation between all the variables in the dataset.
